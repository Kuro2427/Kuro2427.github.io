        <p>Despite me not really being all that good at remembering my dreams, I've been writing down my dreams since about June 2020 when I had a particularly intense dream that shook me to my core.</p>
        <p>I'll try my best to leave these untouched from when I first wrote them down (meaning please do expect some poor grammar and typos, I am writing these down immediately after waking up, after all), 
        but obviously, given the subject at hand, some of the info here needs to be censored, for names and other info that I absolutely cannot share, I'll cross them out, like this: 
        <span class="redact">XXXXX</span>. I'll also cover potentially triggering info and provide the appropriate content warnings like this: [TW: British] <span class="tw">Innit</span>.</p>
        <p>So yeah, I hope you enjoy this look into the depths of my psyche.</p>

        <p>I lived in the US and they found some sort of alien threat on the moon, and every American citizen got drafted to fight up there. Turns out all our houses had these "spaceship kits", basically really really flimsy fabric boxes that once activated with a really confusing remote that I couldn't figure out since it didn't have any sort of instructions,  were supposed to take us to the moon. But they all just levitated for a bit and then failed and started falling. The US government instructed us to boost ourselves up off of walls and roofs and to alwaya be above high ground as a solution to avoid falling. Apparently it was later revealed that the moon was the size of a quarter. For some reason Tom Kenny was in my house too.</p>

There was a voiceover of a woman saying that the child wouldn't grow up properly without a proper family, and a film strip slowly started to form around the video, which was zooming out.</p>

They begged for their lives while crying and Wheatley gave in and gave them freedom to do whatever they wanted. They walked away and were never seen again.</p>

        <p>I went to my godmother's house and at night they said they were taking me somewhere. On the way there we saw the queen who was touring Brazil. When we got there, it was a festival celebrating the VLC video player. Everyone was wearing traffic cone hats, but when I went to buy them they were stupidly overpriced because they were actually drawn by some newgrounds animator. In the shop there was also a pillow of a server rack tgat was apparently the icon for "oldITG",  a Stepmania fork made by the creator of VLC based on another fork called "petITG". There were also rides in the festival like a rollercoaster and a ferris wheel, and there was also a restaurant where they thought I had ordered something and kept trying to make me eat some crab dish they made me</p>

        <h2>May 26 2022</h2>
        <p>It was my birthday and I was watching a show about two friends that lived together. The protagonist was pretty normal and the other character was laid back, lazy and had a pet pig. The protagonist ends up getting a long distance girlfriend and they decide to meet up IRL at a restaurant. So for a few episodes it builds up to them meeting and when they do it turns out Tyler pretended to be you and was taking your date from you. When you barge into the private room you got at the restaurant he laughs an says: Don't worry, she's not interested in you, doesn't even want to marry hahaha. She quickly catches onto what's happening and freaks out. You start fighting with Tyler and the episode ends with you kicking his pig so it flies at the wall and leaves an M shaped black mark with a skull in the middle.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Who the FUCK is Tyler?? Why does the perspective suddenly shift halfway through this entry??? I have so many questions.</span></p>

Right before the ritual they started aging rapidly and one of his uncles had a horribly deformed face. They wanted me to engage in the ritual but i refused. They spent the whole day trying to convince me. At one point one of his aunts tried to sexually seduce me into eating Beatles.

Gradually more horrible things started happening, for example it started raining mice.</p>
        <p>The woman told me I somehow went back in time and started a life in the past, which would then birth her, but this went against space-time continuum, and I had to go to the past to kill my past self and avoid any of the terrible things that were happening. when I get to the past I was inside this big space station and it controlled like undertale and the graphics were pixelated. There were these gloopy Shadow monsters I had to kill,  and I could collect Powerups that were sprinkled through the map.</p>

        <p>I won the drawing contest I'm participating in and the group admin got pissed and left the server. No one undertood why and he wouldn't tell</p>
        <p><span class="note">I think this one was prophetic because the admin of this server ended up getting exposed as a nonce and leaving shortly after I had it.</span></p>

        <p>I was stuck in a saw type prison that had us complete a challenge in a maze every day. I was tortured and abused daily and I had a friend who was a very beaten up version of the scratch cat who'd show up to try to help me out. I eventually broke out br breaking the unprotected window with a piece of metal furniture and jumping out,. I then went on to live with the cat.</p>

        <p>I was browsing the fnaf reddit when I found a video of an epic animated battle between dawko popgoes FaustÃ£o and probably more people. FaustÃ£o specifically spoke with a really bad deepfake and sacrificed himself to help popgoes</p>

        <p>I was helping my friend look for a house when we found one that was abandoned. It was mostly empty with only furniture and some items. We started getting afraid of the owner coming home so we jumped out the window and I turned into a fish. The camera went third person and it controlled like a game. I found a big fish who said to be the owner's, he was apparently thrown away by accident and tried all he could to get back in but couldn't. This was the end of the dream.</p>

        <h2>Jun 6 2020</h2>
        <p>I somehow got inside my consciousness and I got to what is known as the core and it was just a big old summer wars looking mess of vaguely familiar stuff. One thing I remember is that it was all highly functional despite being a mess. Eventually I make my way up and find myself who starts explaining the place to me. And even though I never considered it we somehow ended up kissing. Eventually he started speaking about me as a person and said I was good and should stop being so harsh to myself.</p>
        <p>I think Portal 2 music was playing.</p>
