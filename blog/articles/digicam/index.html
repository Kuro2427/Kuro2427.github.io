        <h2>6 Moths of My Life Through a Digital Camera From 2009</h2>
        <p>DD/MM/YEAR TI:ME</p>

        <p>One aspect of myself I seldom share publicly online is my love for photography. I'm not ashamed of it or anything, I'm actually quite proud of my skills, but ever since I stopped posting the little pictures I like to take to my Instagram circa 2017-ish, I just sort of stopped posting them anywhere. But let's make an exception tonight for this wonderful little piece of hardware that has followed me through some of the craziest 6 months of my life, absolutely no business being as good as it is.</p>
        <p>Around June 2023, perhaps captivated by wonderful websites like <a href="https://7nonsense.neocities.org/">7nonsense</a> and <a href="https://msx.gay">msx.gay</a> and their wonderful usage of older digital cameras, although, admittedly also heavily influenced by fellow gen-zers on TikTok I became... Somewhat infatuated with vintage digital cameras.</p>
        <p>So after doing a bit of research, I bit the bullet and bought a Samsung ES-15. It's a tiny little thing from 2009, admittedly a bit late for digicams, but fortunately, due to it being a budget model, it still uses a CCD sensor, which gives the cameras of the era their signature look.</p>
        <p>After a few weeks of anxious waiting, it finally arrived. And as soon as I secured batteries and an SD card for it, I took this picture from my mom's bedroom window.</p>

        <div class="largepic">
            <a href="pics/SDC10406.JPG" target="_blank"><img src="pics/SDC10406.JPG"></a>
        </div>
        
        <p>To say I was pleased with the results would be the understatement of the century. I was <i>OBSESSED</i></p>
        <p>Part of what blew me away was the resolution it'd output at when in super fine quality mode. At the time we were living in this pretty shitty small little fishing town, and you can perfectly read the sign of the hot dog place with some of the worst hot dogs I've ever had in my entire life, but somehow THE best fries I've eaten before or since. And the place was fairly distant from our apartment</p>
        <p>Shortly after that, our state's orchestra, Cameratta had a concert my mom wanted to go to for ages, so I decided to take my camera with me, and as we sat down, I took a quick pic to test its low light performance.</p>
