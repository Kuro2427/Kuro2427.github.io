            <b>[NSFW] The Tale of the Brazilian Boy Who Came into His Dreamcast</b>
        </div>

        <div class="center">09/01/2022 12:00 AM</div>

        <div class="articletext">

            <p>So there’s this one story that’s circulated around certain circles of the Portuguese speaking sides of the internet, one that’s so iconic and omnipresent that if you were to ask a Brazilian user “Ay, you remember that story about the kid who came into his brand new Dreamcast?”, there’s a 99% chance they'd know what you're talking about.</p>
            <p>Recently, this story has been gaining some traction in the English sides of the net too, after Justin Whang’s amazing vid shed some light on it to our gringo friends. After I too watched this video, one thing led to another and I ended up seeking out any English translations of this sacred text, perhaps out of morbid curiosity, and as expected my findings weren’t exactly great. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great that people have translated this story to English at all, but even Whang himself seemed a bit stumped by some of the translation choices and wording used in the localization, so I thought I’d put my English skills to some use and translate this tale in a way that’s more appealing to my own tastes while also supplying some translator notes to explain some of the more… cultural aspects of this story. ;P So yeah, if you like this translation feel free to share it around the net, you don’t even really need to credit me but it <i>would</i> be kinda cool if you did lol. Either way I’d be happy if more people got to read this legendary tale.</p>
            <p>Oh, and, in case you couldn’t tell, this story contains inappropriate content so minors <b>begone.</b></p>
            <center><h1>- TL;DR: Translation starts here. -</h1></center>

            <p>[Translator's Note: So, for a bit of context, this story was originally posted in a now defunct Brazilian gaming forum (I couldn’t find a reliable source on which exact one it was), so this was originally liveblogged as it happened in real time, and it eventually got converted into <a href="https://aurelio.net/misc/besteiras/gozeinomeudreamcast.txt">a text file</a> for easy reading and sharing, with the different posts being labeled as “parts”.]</p>
            
            <center><p><h1>I BROKE MY DREAMCAST - PART 1</h1></p></center>

            <p>“I broke my Dreamcast like a dumbass. My name is Leonam and I’m 13 years old. I know it sounds like bull but I swear I’m telling the truth. It all started when I was playing my bootleg copy of Crazy Taxi. after a bit, I got bored and wanted to play another game, so I shut off my Dreamcast, ejected Crazy Taxi, but left the lid open (my biggest mistake) to insert the boot disc, but then, my parents decided to leave the house, so I was all by myself. I suddenly got the urge to jack off, so I boot up my computer and load up my favourite webpage (which I discovered in this forum…) and, well, you know. Eventually I feel some pressure building up and I can’t hold it in, but since I was facing my PC, my instinct was to quickly turn left so I wouldn’t get my monitor or keyboard dirty, the issue is, my Dreamcast sits on the same desk as my PC, more specifically to the left of it… That’s right… I CAME INTO MY DREAMCAST… Laugh at me all you want, I don’t know if I find this funny or tragic myself, the lens got all dirty, I tried my hardest to clean it, but the cum dried over it. What the hell do I do now? I begged my parents incessantly for this console and now barely a month into owning it and it’s already broken. My mum will kill me when she finds out that I already broke the console she spent 750 reais to get. [T/N: Roughly $600 or £520 in 2022 money] It’s still under warranty, but what do I tell the store clerk? How do I clean my lens now? Help me please! I promise to never masturbate ever again!”</p>

            <center><p><h1>I BROKE MY DREAMCAST - PART 2</h1></p></center>

            <p>“I ran home from school this morning. When I reached my front door I was breathing heavily and sweating, but guess who I find waiting for me, looking like a general with my Dreamcast on her lap, sitting on the couch? MY. MOTHER… I started sweating even more, and then, she yells: -“<b>LEONAM!</b> WHAT DID YOU SPILL IN THIS VIDEO GAME?”<br><br>
                I almost fell to my knees.<br><br>
                Then I asked her: - “Why do you ask?” And she screamed back: <br><br>
                - “I TOOK THIS CONSOLE TO THE RENTAL SHOP WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND THE CLERK OPENED IT, AND IT WAS STAINED WITH SOMETHING! TELL ME THE TRUTH RIGHT NOW!” <br><br>
                I felt like I was about to faint. She continued: <br><br>
                - “DID YOU SPILL CHOCOLATE MILK ON THIS VIDEO GAME LEONAM? I CAN’T BELIEVE IT! I SPEND THIS MUCH ON A TOY AND IT’S ALREADY BROKEN?!” <br><br>
                - “But I didn’t spill anything on it!” I argued.<br><br>
                - “THEN WHY DOES THIS SMELL LIKE CHEESE? WHAT DID YOU SPILL IN HERE? DID YOU KNOW THE WARRANTY DOESN’T COVER THIS, LEONAM?” She replied.<br><br>
                My legs were shaking.<br><br>
                I booked it to my room and locked the door, I got my phone and decided to try calling Tectoy. [T/N: Tectoy is the company that officially distributes SEGA products in Brazil] Before explaining my predicament to the agent, I swore on everything it wasn’t a prank call, and THE FREAKING REP LAUGHED IN MY FACE! I know it sounds funny but I’m freakin’ PISSED! He then told me I should not try scraping the gunk off the lens because that might damage it, he also said I should take it to the repair centre and tell them the truth so they don’t mess with anything they aren’t supposed to try to fix, but HOW AM I GOING TO TELL A TECHNICIAN THAT I CAME INTO MY DREAMCAST??? (Do I just go up to him and say “Excuse me sir, I accidentally came inside my Dreamcast and I’d like it to be serviced, please???) I also think my mum has already caught on to what’s really happened by now. Of course she recognizes that smell, every Thursday and Tuesday my parents go at it all night long! She just wants me to admit it so she can Rub it in my face! I think I’ll tell my dad… God, I wish I had a younger brother I could blame this on. Damn it! I’m going crazy! YOU GUYS ARE MY LAST BEACON OF HOPE! DO I CLEAN THE LENS MYSELF WITH WATER OR RUBBING ALCOHOL OR SOMETHING??? MY MUM IS GOING TO SKIN ME! HOW CAN I CLEAN SPUNK OFF THE LENS WITHOUT RUINING MY DREAMCAST??????”</p>
            
            <center><p><h1>I BROKE MY DREAMCAST - PART 3</h1></p></center>

            <p>“Before anything I’d like to thank Erik and Francisco for helping me trough this sticky situation. Seriously, thank you. Alright so, first things first since you guys are actually being nice to me: I broke my earlier promise. It was stronger than me, I think I might be addicted, I’m sorry… This time I aimed it properly and didn’t hit anything though! So at least we have that! Anyhow, Francisco Lopez, the Tectoy guy also told me to try one of those lens cleaner CDs, those that have a bunch of songs in different languages and these little brushes that clean the lens while it’s playing, but the issue is, while we do have one of those, it’s meant for lighter grime, like dust and stuff, not slime that’s already gone dry! I tried it and no dice, the console still can’t read any discs. And no Lestat, I wasn’t trying to fuck my Dreamcast, neither was this my first time ejaculating, it’s happened 5 times before the incident, and either way, what does this have to do with anything? Francisco, I’d rather not tell you where I live, because things might get worse. There’s even some guy who says he’s going to archive these threads in a webpage! Imagine if people find out where I live! I’ll suffer for the rest of my existence! I don’t want a wank to ruin my life! I’ve also told this story to some classmates, and they’ve nicknamed me “GONZAGUINHA”, you know, the accordion player! [T/N: This nickname is in reference to the 90s Brazilian slang term for masturbation, “tocar sanfona”, or “to play the accordion”, Leonam himself actually uses this term multiple times in the original version of this story] If anyone has any more insight, please reply to this thread or shoot me a DM, thank you. As for my mother, well, let’s just say I have to constantly clear my browser history because she’s always checking it. She’s just that controlling. Can you imagine if she gets on this website and finds these threads? I think I’d actually die! You may call me childish, but I’m only 13 years old!! I’m still figuring things out! And making mistakes is how you learn and grow as a person! Do you guys seriously think I’d intentionally do this to my Dreamcast?! Help! That’s the only thing I’m asking for right now!”</p>

            <center><p><h1>I BROKE MY DREAMCAST - PART 4</h1></p></center>

            <p>“I’m pleased to announce that my nightmare has finally reached its end, thank God… I didn’t get hit, but it was WAY worse! I had to suffer trough the most embarrassing experience I’ve ever had the displeasure of living. Basically, I noticed things were about to go south, so I opened up to my dad… It was right after I got home from school. I called him into my room, closed the door and told him everything, I must have been red as a bell pepper from all the embarrassment. I told him:
                <br><br>
                - “Dad, for the love of god, do you swear that if I tell you something, you promise to never tell anyone else ever?”
                <br><br>
                And, he promised, or so I thought. Either way, I closed my eyes and said:
                <br><br>
                - “Dad, I was the one who broke the console! But it was an accident, I swear! I… I accidentally jizzed on it…”
                <br><br>
                He laughed. But it wasn’t just a regular laugh. He was FLOORED.
                <br><br>
                - “I didn’t mean to do it! I’m dying of embarrassment, but it’s what happened…” I said.
                <br><br>
                Now, up to this point, things seemed fairly optimistic! He said he’d find a way to fix it, and told me off for accessing adult websites, I told him I’d never visit a porn site ever again, and that seemed to be it. We went and had lunch, and I was finally starting to feel less anxious. Well… You guys know how dads have a seemingly innate ability to solve any problem? Well, I didn’t think mine would solve this situation this way! You know what he did? HE WENT AND TOLD MY MUM… I was in my room, just laying in bed, playing some Street Fighter 2 on my Gameboy, when suddenly my mum walks in with a shit eating grin, holding my dad’s hand.
                <br><br>
                - “Leo”, she said “Me and your father need to talk to you.”
                <br><br>
                And at that moment, I felt my soul leave my body. Even now I still can’t look my mum in the eyes. I then found myself stuck in an impromptu sex ed class… My ears were burning from the embarrassment.
                <br><br>
                - “Leo, You’re no longer a kid now. Your body is changing. Your voice is getting deeper,  there’s hair growing in weird places, you’re becoming a teenager!”, She explained as if I hadn’t already watched those shitty educational tapes they play at school of the cartoon rabbits who grow up and bang all willy-nilly. She then said:
                <br><br>
                - “When you feel the urge to do… <i>That</i>… Go to the bathroom, that way you don’t risk accidentally getting something dirty. And when you’re done, wash your hands so you don’t get sperm on anything”
                <br><br>
                I wanted to spontaneously combust right then and there. And the worst part is, you won’t believe this, SHE THEN CALLED ALL SIX OF MY AUNTS TO TELL THEM I’M ALREADY MASTURBATING! WHY DID SHE EVEN THINK TO DO THAT????  HELL SHE EVEN TOLD THE LADY WHO WORKS HERE, AND SHE’S A FREAKING HOTTIE… Even my grandma ended up calling me to nag me about how this is bad and I have to stop doing it! My reputation with my family is ruined, my mum has completely exposed me to ridicule! Knowing my aunts, even my cousins know by now… I’m screwed. In the end my dad took the console in for repairs, but guess what! The total price of a new lens is 450 REAIS!! [Roughly $360 or £312 in 2022 money] And that’s without service fees. Honestly I think I’d rather just import one from Japan since it’s about the same price anyway, and, well, it’s obviously much better. [T/N <a href="JESSE.jpg">???</a>] I’ve also developed some sort of masturbation anxiety, any time I get that urge I get paranoid I’ll break or get something dirty. I think this experience scarred me for life. And to all the people in this forum that tried to help me, THANK YOU! And learn from my mistakes: NEVER masturbate next to a game console, you might permanently ruin it. (They should put this on the manuals, honestly) Anyways, thank you all for reading.”</p>

            <p>Whew! This one was a doozie to translate, but I’m glad it’s out there. Anyhow, thanks for checking this out I guess lol</p>
